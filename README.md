# Handwriting-Digit-Recognition-Using-SVM
This is a implementation of SVM in famous MNIST handwritten digit dataset using C#.
it has used sequential minimal optimization(SMO) and both Gaussian and Polynomial kernel.
C# and its accord.net machine learning tool have been used to design the SVM and classify the datasets.
The overall detection efficiency is upto 95% for given testing datasets.

N.B: When using this software, one might need to change the path of the training and testing datasets.
